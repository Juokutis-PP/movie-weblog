# 🎬 Movie Review Diary

A simple and fun web app for tracking movies you've watched - along
with your personal ratings and impressions.

## ⭐ Project Overview

Movie Review Diary lets you:

-   Add new movies to your personal diary
-   Edit movie entries anytime
-   View movie posters styled based on genre and your rating
-   Manage the static page through a built‑in **console** that lets you
    edit content, update entries, and maintain the site structure

## 🖥️ Console Editor

The project includes a simple **console interface** that allows you
to:
- Modify the static webpage content
- Add, edit, or remove movie entries
- Adjust visual rules (poster size/genre colors)
- Manage data without directly editing code files

This makes the project flexible and easy to update.

## 🎨 Visual Logic

### **Poster Border Color → Movie Genre**

Each genre is assigned a unique color. Examples:
- 🎭 Drama - Blue
- 😂 Comedy - Yellow
- 👽 Sci-Fi - Purple
- 😱 Horror - Red
- 🧙 Fantasy - Green

### **Poster Size → Your Rating (1-5)**

Your review score controls poster size: 
- ⭐ 1 (smallest)
- ⭐⭐ 2
- ⭐⭐⭐ 3
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ 4
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 5 (biggest)
