with your personal ratings and impressions.

## ⭐ Project Overview

Movie Review Diary lets you:

-   Add new movies to your personal diary
-   Edit movie entries anytime
-   View movie posters styled based on genre and your rating

### **Poster Size → Your Rating (1-5)**

Your review score controls poster size:
